# Rails Track

## Before you get started...
+ You should feel very comfortable with Ruby. Check out the resources in the Ruby Postwork plan - if you haven't done all of those labs, do them.


## Objective
 + A student who completes this material should be able to build a Rails application that stresses the importance of design patterns and test driven development.


## Writing Clean Code

## + Refactoring
+ Read the following materials and spend some time refactoring [this project](https://github.com/SophieDeBenedetto/refactor-lecture-sample-app-web-0716/tree/master).

 *Note: This repo has two branches. Spend time refacotring the master branch and when you think you are done, check the refactor branch to check your solutions*
	+ [Refactoring with Adapter](http://www.thegreatcodeadventure.com/rails-refactoring-part-i-the-adapter-pattern/)
	+ [Refactoring with Services](https://thegreatcodeadventure.com/rails-refactoring-part-ii-services)
	+ [Refactoring with Decorator Pattern](https://thegreatcodeadventure.com/rails-refactoring-part-ii-the-decorator-pattern)

## + Testing
+ Read [this](https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/ruby-rails-testing),
+ And [this](https://robots.thoughtbot.com/how-we-test-rails-applications)
+ Go back and try to add test to a previous rails project

## Supplemental Material
+ Spend about 45 minutes a day watching/reading one these materials and try to apply what you learn in a project or lesson. **DO NOT** spend all of your time trying to read a book cover to cover.
